## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Sony. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

Running homebrew on your device is 100% free on your device.

## What can I do with a hacked PS4?

+ Customize your home screen with user-created themes.
+ Use "ROM hacks" for games that you own
+ Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games.
+ Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators.
+ Dump your games to a format you can install, and play them without needing the card.
+ Stream live gameplay to your PC wirelessly with Chiaki.
+ Play your PSP games on your PS4

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of PS4 hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.**
+ This guide will work on all PS4, and PS4 Pro devices in all regions on firmwares from 1.00 to 9.00
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, PSN Account, saves, etc. will be preserved).
+ **Keep your device plugged in throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off!**
